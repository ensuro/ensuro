# Contributing to Ensuro

Thank you for your interest in Ensuro! We highly appreciate even the smallest of fixes or additions to our project.

## Basic Contributing Guidelines

We use the same guidelines for contributing code to any of our repositories, any developers wanting to contribute to Ensuro must create pull requests. This process is described in the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request). Each pull request should be started against the master branch in the respective Ensuro repository. After a pull request is submitted the Ensuro team will review the submission and give feedback via the comments section of the pull request. After the submission is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the master branch of the source. 

Please note the below! We appreciate everyone following the guidelines.

* No --force pushes or modifying the Git history in any way;
* Use non-master branches, using a short meaningful description, with words separated by dash (e.g. 'fix-this-bug');
* All modifications must be made in a pull-request to solicit feedback from other contributors.
